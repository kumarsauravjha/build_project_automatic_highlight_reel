## **Overview**
The **Automatic Highlight Reel** project automates the process of identifying key moments in video footage, applying animations, and generating engaging highlight videos. This is especially useful for sports, events, or any scenario requiring quick post-processing of large video datasets.

Key components include:
- Time classification for event detection.
- Frame filtering for extracting significant frames.
- Video enhancement with OpenCV.
- Animated transitions and text overlays.

---

## **Features**
- **Event-Based Frame Filtering:** Automatically identifies and extracts relevant moments.
- **Custom Animations:** Add transitions, floating text, and effects to enhance video quality.
- **OpenCV Integration:** For video processing and frame manipulation.
- **Modular Code:** Easy to extend and adapt to different use cases.
- **Data Analysis Support:** Includes scripts for analyzing and visualizing time-classified events.

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/build_project_automatic_highlight_reel.git
   cd build_project_automatic_highlight_reel
   ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Usage**

1. **Frame Filtering:**
   Use `filter_predictions.py` to process raw predictions and filter significant frames.

2. **Video Processing with Animations:**
   Execute `openCV_create_animation.py` to create a video with transitions, animations, and overlays.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   Run `data_analysis.py` or explore `time_classification_with_results.ipynb` to analyze the performance of the classification model.

4. **Training Time Classification Model:**
   Use `time_classification_modeling_on_all_data.py` to train and test the time classification model on your dataset.
